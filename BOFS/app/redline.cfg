    <p><b>Purpose(s) and Objective(s) of the Research:</b> Online games are extremely popular, and game designers make many choices in how to display information to a player. The choices made by game designers may have a profound impact on how people experience the game. In this study we are comparing different game designs to see how they might affect player experience.</p>

    <p><b>Procedures:</b></br>

        <ul>
            <li>In this study, you will be asked to fill in a questionnaires about yourself, play a game multiple times, and complete several questionnaires about your game play experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Potential Risks and Benfits:</b> There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this research.  Your participation will help us to design games and to understand how games can be better designed. For your participation you will receive payment as detailed in the HIT description.</p>

    <p><b>Confidentiality:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. The entire process and data will be anonymized.  Data will only be presented in the aggregate and any individual user comments will be anonymized prior to presentation in academic venues.</li>
            <li>The research team named above will have access to the data to ensure that your confidentiality is protected, anonymized data may be shared with other researchers collaborating with the authors listed above.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Right to Withdraw:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Your participation is voluntary. You may withdraw from the research project for any reason, at any time without explanation.</li>
            <li>Should you wish to withdraw, you may do so at any point, and we will not use your data; we will destroy all records of your data.</li>
            <li>Your right to withdraw data from the study will apply until the data have been aggregated (one week after study completion). After this date, it is possible that some form of research dissemination will have already occurred and it may not be possible to withdraw your data</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
